# ClipStrip
clipstrip - Remove formatting from text in the clipboard

## Use case
99.9% of my everyday uses of copy-paste involves me wanting to copy some text, but NOT
keep the formatting. The fact that formatting is basically always kept is causing great
annoyance as the resulting text is often pasted incorrectly and messes up the formatting
in the target document.

This usually ends in me opening notepad, pasting the text in there and then copying it
from notepad again to remove the formatting.

## Functionality
The only thing this program does is to check if the clipboard contains text with
formatting, and in that case removes the formatting but keeps the text.

## Requirements
Java 1.8 or higher.

## Tips
For Windows: Download the release JAR and place it in your start menu to allow for
quick access.
